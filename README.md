I FORGOT TO SAVE THIS THE FIRST TIME AROUND WTF

Alright whatever. I've said my piece once before. This is me trying to catch up/refresh my knowledge with The Odin Project...blah blah blah.

I've already done this project once before, but I'm going back over it for fun and focusing on some areas I didn't last time around.

Updates to follow.

!!!! Well I did it. It's not perfect by any means, but I'm satisfied with how it turned out. This time around I focused solely on CSS Grid and learned how to position items using it and a combination of the 'position' rule.

Was it frustrating at times? Yes. Did I have fun though? Absolutely. I think I've got a good grasp on the basics of HTML and CSS after this, which is great. Now....time for Javascript...
